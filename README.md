# Architecture Assignment

Rythm (https://rythmbot.co) is a Discord music bot that plays music on receiving requests from users.

This is a two part question:

a) How would you go about designing such a bot? Please try Rythm to understand what it does.

b) Rythm is currently on over 5 million servers serving over 50 million users. How would you design your bot if it were to handle these numbers?

We expect you to come up with solutions for both (a) and (b), in as much detail as you can, including system architecture diagrams and the kind of infrastructure you would use. There are no constraints from our end on what you can or cannot use, but you should try to optimise whatever solution you come up with.

Please submit a presentation when you are done. You donâ€™t have to implement the bot itself, but bonus points if you can!
